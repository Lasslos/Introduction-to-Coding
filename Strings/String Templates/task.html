<h2>Theory: String Templates</h2>

<p>This was pretty boring, right? Nobody would ever greet someone just with their name.
That is why we need to combine the name with more text. Here is how it works:</p>
<code>"Hello, $name!"</code>
<p>We use \$ to refer to a variable.
    When this code is executed, the $ will be replaced by the value in the variable.</p>
