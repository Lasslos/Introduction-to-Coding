<h2>Theory: First Data Type: Text</h2>

<p><strong>Text</strong> is arguably one of the most important data types. Its name is <strong>String</strong>
in almost all programming languages. Create a string by placing some text into <strong>quotation marks.</strong></p>
<p>
    <code>"This is a String!"</code>
</p>
<p>You can output this String by wrapping it into a print statement: <br>
    <code>println("This is a String!")</code> <br>
    We will not use that a lot.
</p>
<p>Instead, we will use <code>return "This is a String"</code>, since most of the output you make is checked by tests.
    Testing, however, is not easily possible when the output is displayed. That is why <code>return</code>, which
passes the value to a method, in this case a testing method, will be used more</p>
