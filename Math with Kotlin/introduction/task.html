<h2>Math with Kotlin</h2>

<h4>
    Disclaimer: This lesson is meant to be taught by an experienced programmer.
</h4>
<p>
    Computers are great in two things: Math and storing data. <br>
    Today, we are going to cover the math part. <br>
    <strong>This is very important to become a good programmer. </strong>
    It would be optimal if you had someone teaching you this instead of learing it yourself.
</p>

<p>
    Start off by trying to put some basic addition, e.g. "1 + 2"
    into a print statement. It is explained in the first hint again.
    Don't forget to put <strong>Quotation Marks</strong>.
</p>
<div class="hint">
    Use println("Your text here") to output something to the console.
</div>

<details><summary><strong>Open this after you tried</strong></summary>
    <p style="margin-top: 12px;">
        As you may have noticed, it didn't do any math. That's because a print statement with quotation marks
        takes the input as a <strong>String</strong>, which is the word for <strong>Text</strong> in programming.
    </p>

        Please go on with the next lesson.
