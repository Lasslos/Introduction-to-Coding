<h2>Input</h2>
<p>So far, we used <code>readLine()</code> to get user input. The problem is that this will always be text, not numbers.</p>
<p>To get numbers, we do the following:</p>
<code>var input = readLine()!!.toInt()</code>
<p>You already know what <code>var input = readLine()</code> does. Let's break the rest apart: <br>
    <code>!!</code> - This is to tell the computer that we don't care about null safety. You don't have to understand that
    right now. <br>
    <code>.toInt()</code> - In Kotlin, there are different <strong>types of data</strong>. Here are some that you should know:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>String - Plain Text</li>
    <li>Integer (short form: int) - Whole Numbers, so without decimal places</li>
    <li>Double - Numbers with decimal places.</li>
    <li>Boolean - True or False</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike other programming languages, the data type will not change "just because".<br>
    To change it, we have to use methods like <code>.toInt()</code> to change the datatype.
    Be careful with this method, since it will throw an error when using it on non-number text.
