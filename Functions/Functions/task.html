<h2>Functions</h2>

<p>
    A <strong>functions</strong> is a block of code. It is executed step by step, statement after statement.
    You already know a function:
</p>
<pre><code style="display: block;">
    fun main() {

    }
</code></pre>
<p>However, this is not a very good example of a function, since it leaves out a lot of things that can be done with functions.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at another example: </p>
<pre><code style="display: block;">
    fun printText() {

    }
</code></pre>
<p>This is the <strong>main function</strong>. We are going to break it apart to see what we can do with it.</p>
<p><code>fun</code> -> This is the <strong>keyword</strong> of a function. Every function begins with it.
    Its purpose is that your computer know what to do with it.</p>
<p><code>main</code> -> This is the <strong>name</strong> of a function. It can be anything. </p>
<p><code>()</code> -> This is the <strong>parameter list</strong> of a function. When your function
needs to be input in order to run </p>
