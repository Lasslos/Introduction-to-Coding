<h2>Input and Output</h2>

<p>You already know how to "output something". The term for that is printing to the console. It works like that:</p>
<code>println("This text will be printed!")</code>
<p>println means print line. It automatically adds a new line after printing.</p>
<p>There is another way to print stuff:</p>
<code>print("This text will be printed, but without a linebreak!")</code>
<p>This does not add another line to the console.</p>
