<h2>Variables</h2>
<h3>Disclaimer: This lesson should be taught by an experienced programmer.</h3>
<p>The second thing that computers are incredibly good in, is storing data. I am going to show
you the most convenient way in Kotlin.</p>
<p>Before we store data, we have to understand data types. You already know a few:</p>
<ul>
    <li>String [Text]</li>
    <li>Integer, called Int [Whole numbers]</li>
    <li>Double [Numbers with decimal places]</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Before you reveal the hints, try to guess how it could work, if you have an idea.
That way, you learn more efficient.</strong></p>
<p>
    Write a program that begins with a variable with the value
    <strong>"Hello World"</strong>.
    Try the following things in the code:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Print the variable.</li>
    <li>Change the value in it and print it.</li>
    <li>Try to change it to a number and print it.</li>
    <li>Create a new variable with a number in it and do math with it. Use print statements for that.</li>
    <li>Save the output of a calculation in a variable and print it later.</li>
    <li>Compare variables instead of numbers, the same way. Also compare a variable to a number.</li>

</ul>
<div class="hint">
    How you store data: <br>
    <code>var [name of variable] = [some data]</code><br>
    Example: <br>
    <code>var data = "Hello World!"</code>
</div>
<div class="hint">
    You can access the data like that:<br>
    <code>
        var data = "Hello World" <br>
        print(data)
    </code>
</div>
<div class="hint">
    You can also specify the type of data to be stored:<br>
    <code>var data: String = "Hello World!"</code>
</div>
<div class="hint">
    If you want to change the value, simply reassign the variable:<br>
    <code>data = "Something else"</code><br>
    That will delete the previous value in the variable, and put a new value into it.
</div>
<div class="hint">
    There may be some cases where you want a variable to be unchangeable. It also helps to understand the code,
    so try to use this feature as often as possible. <br>
    <code>val moreData = "This is unmodifiable, because it starts with the keyword val"</code>
</div>
