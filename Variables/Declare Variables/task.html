<h2>Variables</h2>
<h3>Disclaimer: This lesson should be taught by an experienced programmer.</h3>
<p>The second thing that computers are incredibly good in, is storing data. I am going to show
you the most convenient way in kotlin.</p>
<p>Before we store data, we have to understand data types. You already know a few:</p>
<ul>
    <li>String [Text]</li>
    <li>Integer, called Int [Whole numbers]</li>
    <li>Double [Numbers with decimal places]</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Here is how you store data: <br>
    <code>var [name] = [some data]</code>
</p>
<p>
    That could look like that: <br>
    <code>var data = "Hello World!"</code>
</p>
<p>
    You can also specify the type of data to be stored:<br>
    <code>var data: String = "Hello World!"</code>
</p>
<p>
    If you want to change the value, simply reassign the variable:<br>
    <code>data = "Something else"</code><br>
    That will delete the previous value in the variable, and put a new value into it.
</p>
<p>
    There may be some cases where you want a variable to be unchangeable. It also helps to understand the code,
    so try to use this feature as often as possible. <br>
    <code>val moreData = "This is unmodifiable, because it starts with the keyword val"</code>
</p>

<p>
    To actually access the data:<br>
    <code>
        val data = "Hello World" <br>
        print(data)
    </code>
</p>
