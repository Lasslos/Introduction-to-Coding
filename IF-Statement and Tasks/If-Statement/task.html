<h2>IF-Statement</h2>

<p>We are going to take a look at if-statements. They job is very important. You can add optional code,
    depending on what the situation is.
</p>

<code>
    if (something) { <br>
    &nbsp    //Do stuff<br>
    }<br>
</code>
<p>
    The something is replaced with a <strong>boolean</strong>. It is a data type that has exactly two states:
    <strong>true or false</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    You already know some of these
    booleans. They occur when comparing two numbers to each other.
    So, an example of a program with an if-statement could be this:
</p>
<code>val number = 3</code>
<code>
    val number = 3\n
    if (number < 6) {  <br>
    &nbsp    print("The number is smaller than six!")  <br>
    }  <br>
</code>
