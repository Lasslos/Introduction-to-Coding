<h2>IF-Statement</h2>

<p>We are going to take a look at if-statements. They job is very important. You can add optional code,
    depending on what the situation is.
</p>

<pre><code>
    if (something) {
    &nbsp    //Do stuff
    }
</code></pre>
<p>
    The something is replaced with a <strong>boolean</strong>. It is a data type that has exactly two states:
    <strong>true or false</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    You already know some of these
    booleans. They occur when comparing two numbers to each other.
    So, an example of a program with an if-statement could be this:
</p>
<pre><code style="display: block;">
    val number = 3
    if (number < 6) {
    &nbsp    print("The number is smaller than six!")
    }
</code></pre>
<p>
    You can enhance your if statement with the keywork <code>else</code>:
</p>
<pre><code style="display: block;">
    val number = 3
    if (number < 6) {
        println("The number is smaller than six!")
    } else {
        println("The number is not smaller than six")
    }
</code></pre>
<p>
    For even more specific cases, use the keyword <code>else if</code>:
</p>
<pre><code style="display: block;">
    val number = 3
    if (number < 6) {
        println("The number is smaller than six!")
    } else if (number == 42) {
        println("The number is equal to 42!")
    } else {
        println("The number is not smaller than six and not equal to 42!")
    }
</code></pre>
