<h2>IF-Statement</h2>

<p>We are going to take a look at if-statements. They work like that: <br></p>
<code>
    if (something) { <br>
        //Do stuff<br>
    }<br>
</code>
<p>
    The something is replaced with something that can be true or false.
    This is called a <strong>boolean</strong>. You already know some of these
    booleans. They occur when comparing two numbers. That's right, it's nothing else.
    So, an example of a program with an if-statement could be this:
</p>
<code>
    val number = 3; <br>
    if (number < 6) {  <br>
        print("The number is smaller than six!")  <br>
    }  <br>
</code>
<p>When the first condition fails, you may want to catch that. For that, use the else block.</p>
<code>
    val number = 3; <br>
    if (number < 6) {  <br>
    print("The number is smaller than six!")  <br>
    } else { <br>
    print("The number is not smaller than six!")  <br>
    } <br>
</code>
<p>
    And for real complex things, use else if:
</p>
<code>
    val number = 3; <br>
    if (number < 6) {  <br>
    print("The number is smaller than six!")  <br>
    } else if (number == 9) { <br>
    print("The number is equal to seven!")  <br>
    } else {<br>
    print("The number is not smaller than six and not equal to 9.")<br>
    }<br>
</code>
