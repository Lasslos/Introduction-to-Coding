<h2>Math with Kotlin</h2>

<p>
    Try to do simple addition. How does it work?
</p>
<div class="hint">
    Use <strong>+</strong> to do addition.
</div>
<p>
    Try to do the same with subtraction.
</p>
<div class="hint">
    Use <strong>-</strong> to do subtraction.

    Try out multiplication. If you can't figure out what symbol is used, feel free to use the hint.
</p>
<div class="hint">
    Use <strong>*</strong> to do multiplication.
</div>
<p>
    Division? Pay attention if it rounds, and if yes up or down? What happens if you
    replace something like <strong>3 / 2</strong> by <strong>3.0 / 2.0</strong>
</p>
<div class="hint">
    Use <strong>/</strong> to do division with only integers or only doubles. Then try to mix both of them.
    while a Double also <strong>supports decimal places</strong>.
    When doing an Integer Division, Kotlin will always <strong>round down.</strong>
</div>

    Does Kotlin follow <strong>BEDMAS?</strong> Does it support <strong>( or ) ?</strong> Try it out!
</p>
<div class="hint">
    Kotlin follows the <strong>BEDMAS</strong> rules. That also means you can use <strong>( and )</strong>.
