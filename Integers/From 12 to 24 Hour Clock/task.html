<h2>12-Hour Clock, 24-Hour Clock</h2>

<ul>
    <li>You get an Integer from 0 to 12 and a String that is either <code>"AM"</code> or <code>"PM"</code></li>
    <li>If the number is smaller than zero or bigger than 12, return <code>-1</code> since the input is invalid</li>
    <li>If the String is neither AM or PM, return <code>-1</code></li>
    <li>Return the time in 24-Hour Clock</li>
</ul>
<div class="hint">
  When it's currently AM, the hour on a 24-Hour clock is the same as on a 12-Hour clock <br>
    When it's currently PM, the hour on a 24-Hour Clock is exactly 12 bigger than on a 12-Hour clock
