<h2>Compare numbers to each other.</h2>

<p>Often, we need to compare numbers in if-statements. In Kotlin, we use these operators for it:</p>
<p><strong><</strong> corresponds to <strong>is smaller than.</strong> Examples: 3 < 2 is false. 5 < 16 is true. 7 < 7 is false.</p>
<p><strong>></strong> corresponds to <strong>is bigger than.</strong> Examples: 3 > 2 is true. 5 > 16 is false. 7 > 7 is false.</p>
<p><strong>==</strong> corresponds to <strong>is equal</strong> Examples: 3 == 2 is false. 5 == 16 is false. 7 == 7 is true.</p>
<p><strong><=</strong> corresponds to <strong>is smaller or equal to.</strong> Examples: 3 <= 2 is false. 5 <= 16 is true. 7 <= 7 is true.</p>
<p><strong>>=</strong> corresponds to <strong>is bigger or equal to.</strong> Examples: 3 >= 2 is true. 5 >= 16 is false. 7 >= 7 is true.</p>
<p>Take the time and try to put some of these statements into a print statement. </p>
