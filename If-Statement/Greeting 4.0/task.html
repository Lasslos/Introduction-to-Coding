<h4>Greeting 4.0</h4>
<p>Please ignore the message: "Cascade 'if' should be replaced with 'when'." You will learn that soon enough.
Write a program that asks a person for their name.</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the name is Mr. Treber or Mr. Dolgopol, then return "Good morning sir!"</li>
    <li>If the name is Joe, respond "Mama!"</li>
    <li>If the name is Google Assistant, greet it with "Hey Google!"</li>
    <li>If the name is none of the above, return "Hello there!"</li>
</ul>
