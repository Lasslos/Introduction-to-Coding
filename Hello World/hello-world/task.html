<p>
    This is an introductory course to the Kotlin Programming Language, made by Laslo Hauschild.
    It is meant for absolute beginners.

    Kotlin uses the <strong>Java Virtual Machine</strong> to run its code.
    That means, everything that works with Java works with Kotlin.
    Kotlin is the <strong>better Java</strong>. In 2016, Google announced to replace Java
    with Kotlin as the preferred language for Android App Development. And its usage go much further.
