<h2>How this course works</h2>

<p>This course is made for absolute beginners. There will be different types of lessons.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Theory:</strong> Instead of reading the description, it should be taught by an experienced programmer.
        Always code along! That means that you always should try out, how something shown to you works.
        <strong>Instead of asking what if questions, try it yourself and then ask or make a comment!</strong>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Output:</strong> Coding exercise that is validated by output. It starts with the
        <strong>main function</strong> and uses print.</li>
    <li><strong>Edu:</strong> Coding exercise that is validated by tests. It starts with a
    <strong>custom function.</strong> These functions will get some information and return some information.</li>
</ul>
