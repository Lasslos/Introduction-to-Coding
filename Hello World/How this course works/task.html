<h2>How this course works</h2>

<p>This course is made for absolute beginners. There will be different types of lessons.
There will be two types of tasks: Theory and Exercise</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Theory:</strong> Instead of reading the description, it should be taught by an experienced programmer.
        Always code along! That means that you always should try out, how something shown to you works.
        <strong>Instead of asking what if questions, try it yourself and then ask or make a comment!</strong>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Edu:</strong> Coding exercise that is validated by tests. It starts with a
    <strong>custom function.</strong> These functions will get some information and return some information.</li>
</ul>

<p>What are custom functions?</p>
<p>Almost every code in Kotlin executes in <strong>functions</strong>. This is a function:</p>
<pre><code>
    fun name(input: Int): String {

    }
</code></pre>
<p>
    Lets break that apart. <br>
    <code>fun</code> is a <strong>keyword</strong>. It tells the computer that this is a function.<br>
    <code>name</code> is the <strong>name</strong> of the function. It can be anything. <br>
    <code>(input: Int)</code> This is the section of the function that declares what the input
    will be. Every time the function is executed, some test functions will give you a set of values that
    you don't know. But how exactly does the input work?
</p>
<p>
    <code>input</code> is just the name. It can be anything and will normally be something meaningful
    that makes sense in the context. <br>
    <code>: Int</code> is the type of data that will be in the variable. What exactly the different data types
    are is not important right now.
</p>
<p>Last but not least, there is <code>: String </code> at the end of the function. This is, again,
<strong>a type of data</strong>. Here, it is the type of data that the function result should be.
    This result is "returned" by: <code>return "result"</code>
